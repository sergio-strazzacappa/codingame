# Longest Coast

## Goal

Given a **n** \* **n** grid, output the index of the island with the longest
coast, followed by the amount of water it holds. (Island indexes are 1-indexed)

An island is made of one or more **#** characters, we'll call that an island
block. While water is represented by **~**.

We start from the first row and go through the columns left to right till the
last row, when encountering a block that you haven't visited yet, that means it
is the start of a new island, therefore that is now the **i**th island, it may
connect other blocks in four directions: up, down, left and right, meaning only
horizontal and vertical directions. these blocks may also connect other blocks,
this goes on until there are no other connected blocks, and once there is no
connection anymore, we look for a new island using the same process.

If multiple islands have the same amount of water, output the one with a smaller index.

**Example**:

With **n** = 5:

<pre style="color:#FFFFFF">
~~~~#
~~~##
~~~~~
~##~~
~~~~~
</pre>

We see that the 2nd island is the one with the longest coast, because the first
block is surrounded by 3 water blocks and so is the second block. once summed up
we get 6, which is greater than the first island having only 4. so in this case,
we output **2** **6** (island 2, 6 water blocks).

## Input

-   Line 1: An integer **n** representing the size of the grid
-   Next **n** lines: A row of the grid of length **n**

## Output

-   The index of the island with the longest coast followed by the amount of
    water it holds separated by a space

## Constraints

-   3 &leq; **n** &leq; 50
