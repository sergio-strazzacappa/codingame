# Object Insertion

## Goal

You have an object to insert into a partially filled 2D grid.

You need to count the number of ways the object can fit into the empty areas of
the grid.

If there is one and only one way, you also must display the grid with the
inserted object.

Flips and rotations are **NOT** allowed on the object.

The object is represented as a series of strings, in which dots **.** are empty
areas and stars **\*** are physical parts of the object.

**Example**:

<pre style="color:#FFFFFF">
*.
**
.*
</pre>

The grid is provided in a similar fashion, dots **.** are empty areas and
number signs **#** are filled areas of the grid.

**Notes**:

-   The representation of the object never presents empty rows or columns
-   The dimensions of the object are always less than or equal to the dimensions
    of the grid

## Input

-   First line: Two integers **a** and **b** separated by a space, denoting the
    numbers of rows and columns of the representation of the object
-   Next **a** lines: Line of length **b** composed of the characters **.** and
    **\***
-   Next line: Two integers **c** and **d** separated by a space, denoting the
    numbers of rows and columns of the grid
-   Next **c** lines: Line of length **d** composed of the characters **.** and
    **#**

## Output

-   First line: Number of ways to insert the object in the grid
-   If this number equals 1:
    -   Next **c** lines: Line of length **d** composed of the characters **.**,
        **#** and **\***, showing grid state after object insertion

## Constraints

-   1 &leq; **a** &leq; **c** &leq; 10
-   1 &leq; **b** &leq; **d** &leq; 10
