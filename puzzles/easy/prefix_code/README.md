# Prefix Code

## Goal

Given a fixed set of characters, a code is a table that gives the encoding to
use for each character.

A _prefix code_ is a code with the **prefix property**, which is that there is
no character with an encoding that is a prefix (initial segment) of the encoding
of another character.

Your goal is to **decode** an encoded string using the given prefix code, or say
that is not possible.

Example of encoding: \
Given the string _abracadabra_ and the prefix code: \
a -> 1 \
b -> 001 \
c -> 011 \
d -> 010 \
r -> 000

The resulting encoding is: **10010001011101010010001**

Thus, if your are given the code above and the input
**10010001011101010010001**, you should output the string _abracadabra_.

With the same prefix code, if the input is **0000**, then you should tell that
there is an error at index 3. Indeed, the first three characters of this input
can be decoded to give an _r_, but that leaves **0**, which cannot be decoded.

    challenge by building efficient prefix codes:

## Input

-   Line 1: A single integer **N** representing the number of association in
    the prefix-code table
-   Next **N** lines: A binary code **Bi** and an integer **Ci**, which tells
    that the character with ASCII code **Ci** will be encoded by **Bi**
-   Next line: The binary code **S** of an encoded string

## Output

-   If it is not possible to decode the encoded string, print **DECODE FAIL AT
    INDEX i** with **i** the first index in the encoded string where the
    decoding fails (index starts from 0)
-   Otherwise print the decoded string

## Constraints

-   0 &leq; **N**, **C** &leq; 127
-   **S** and the binary codes **Bi** have a length less that or equal to 5000
