# Snakebyte - Release date: `10/03/2026`

## Goal

Snag power sources to grow your snake-like robots and make sure you have the
biggest bots standing.

## Rules

The game is played on a **grid**.

Each player controls a team of **snakebots**. On each turn, the snakebots move
**simultaneously** according to the players' commands.

### Map

The grid is seen from the side, and is made up of **platforms**. Platforms are
impassable cells.

On this grid you may find parts of a snakebot's **body** and **power sources**.

### Snakebot

Snakebots are multiple adjacent cell-sized body parts. The first cell being
their **head**.

Snakebots are affected by **gravity**. Meaning **at least one body** part must
be above something **solid** or they will **fall**.

Other snakebots are considered **solid**, as well as **platforms** and
**power sources**.

### Movement

Snakebots are **perpetually moving**, and will on each turn head in the last
direction they were facing unless given a new direction to turn by the player.

The starting direction is **up**.

When moving, a snakebot will advance their head in the direction it is facing,
and the rest of its body parts will follow.

- **Case 1**: If the cell the snakebot's head has moved into contains a
  **platform** or other **body part**, the snakebot's head is destroyed and the
  next part in its body becomes the **new head**. This only happens if is has at
  least three remaining parts. If not, the whole snakebot is removed.

- **Case 2**: If the cell the snakebot has moved into contains a
  **power source**, the snakebot will **eat it**. This has two effects:
    1. The snakebot **grows**, a new body part appears at the end of its body.
    2. This cell is no longer considered **solid**.

These collisions are resolved simultaneously for all snakebots.

- **Special case**: If multiple snakebot heads collide on a cell containing a
  **power source**, that power source is considered
  **eaten by each of those snakebots**!

Once movement and removals are resolved, the snakebots all **fall** downwards
until a body part lands on something **solid**.

It is possible to extend your **snakebot** beyond the borders of the grid. But
falling out of the playing area will result in the snakebot being removed.

### Actions

Each turn, players must provide at least one action on the standard output.

Actions must be separated by a semicolon **;** and be one of the following.

Commands to move snakebot with id `id`:

- `id UP`: sets a snakebot's direction to UP **(x,y)=(0,-1)**.
- `id DOWN`: sets a snakebot's direction to DOWN **(x,y)=(0,1)**.
- `id LEFT`: sets a snakebot's direction to LEFT **(x,y)=(-1,0)**.
- `id RIGHT`: sets a snakebot's direction to RIGHT **(x,y)=(1,0)**.

Any of the movement actions can be followed by text which will be displayed
above the appropriate snakebot for **debugging** purposes.

Special commands:

- `MARK x y`: places a marker at the specified coordinates. Markers are visible
  in the viewer for **debugging** purposes.
- `WAIT`: do nothing.

## Game end

The game is over if any of these are true at the end of a turn:

- All of a player's snakebots have been removed.
- There are no more **power sources** left to eat.
- 200 turns have passed.

### Victory conditions

Have more total body parts across all your snakebots than your opponent at the
end of the game.

### Defeat conditions

Your program does not provide a command in the alloted time or one of the
commands is invalid.

## Technical details

- The source code of this game will be published to
  [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/CodinGame/WinterChallenge2026-Exotec).

## Debugging tips

- Use the `MARK x y` action to highlight up to 4 cells per turn.
- Hover over the grid to see extra information on the cell under your mouse.
- Press the gear icon on the viewer to access extra display options.
- Use the keyboard to control the action: space to play/pause, arrows to step 1
  frame at a time.

## Game protocol

### Initialization input

- **Line 1**: `myId`, an integer for your player identification (**0** or
  **1**).
- **Line 2**: `width`, an integer for the width of the grid.
- **Line 3**: `height` an integer for the height of the grid.

- **Next** `height` **lines**: One row of the grid containing `width` characters
  each. Each character can be:
    - **#**: a **platform**.
    - **.**: a **free** cell.

- **Next line**: `snakbotsPerPlayer` an integer for amount of snakebots each
  player controls.

- **Next** `snakbotsPerPlayer` **lines**: One integer `snakebotId` for each of
  the snakebots controlled by **you**.

- **Next** `snakbotsPerPlayer` **lines**: One integer `snakebotId` for each of
  the snakebots controlled by **your opponent**.

### Input for one game turn

- **First line**: `powerSourceCount`, one integer for the number of remaining
  **power sources** on the grid.

- **Next** `powerSourceCount` lines: The following **2** integers for each power
  source:
    - `x`: X coordinate
    - `y`: Y coordinate

- **Next line**: `snakebotCount`, one integer for the number of remaining
  **snakebots** on the grid.

- **Next** `snakebotCount` lines: The following **2** inputs for each snakebot:
    - `snakebotId`: an integer for this snakebot's identifier
    - `body`: a string of colon (**:**) separated coordinates, each coordinate
      being the position of a body part with the form "**x,y**". The first
      coordinate in the list is the **head**.
      _Example: "**0,1:1,1:2,1**" is a snakebot with a head at **x=0** and
      **y=1** with two more body parts to the right._

### Output

A single line, containing at least one action:

- `id UP` where id is the `snakebotId` of a snakebot you control.
- `id DOWN` where id is the `snakebotId` of a snakebot you control.
- `id LEFT` where id is the `snakebotId` of a snakebot you control.
- `id RIGHT` where id is the `snakebotId` of a snakebot you control.
- `MARK x y`: you may mark up to **four** coordinates per turn.
- `WAIT`

Instructions are separated by semi-columns (**;**). For example:

    1 LEFT;2 RIGHT;MARK 12 2

## Constraints

- Response time per turn &leq; **50**ms
- Response time for the first turn &leq; **1000**ms
- 15 &leq; `width` &leq; 45
- 10 &leq; `height` &leq; 30
- 1 &leq; `snakebotCount` &leq; 8
