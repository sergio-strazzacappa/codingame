## Goal

The task here is to print the ASCII representation of **n** mountains where the
**height** of each mountain is given.

## Input

-   Line 1: an integer **n** for the number of mountains
-   Line 2: **n** space-separated integers for the **height** of each mountain

## Output

-   An ASCII representation of the mountain where each rise in the mountain is
    represented by **/** and fall by **\\** (output lines shall not contain
    trailing spaces)

## Constraints

-   0 &lt; **n** &lt; 15
-   0 &lt; **height** &lt; 15
-   Every mountain's base starts on the bottom-most line
