# Timer for Clash of Code

## Goal

You have to implement a version of the timer in Clash of Code. The timer starts
at 5:00 and runs towards 0:00. The timer stop time changes based on players
joining.

Here are the rules:

- Every time a player joins the clash, the timer stop time is set to \
  `t` - 256 / ( 2^(`p` - 1) ) \
  where `t` is current time in seconds and `p` is the number of players in the
  room before the new player joined
- If the result is under 0:00, set it to 0:00
- If a player joins at the same time the game is supposed to start, set the new
  timer stop time instead of starting the game

For example:

- At 5:00 the timer starts, and there is one player (the one who started the
  clash)
- At 4:47 the second player joins $\rightarrow$ set to start 256 seconds from
  now, at 0:31
- At 3:56 the third player joins $\rightarrow$ set to start 128 seconds from
  now, at 1:48
- At 3:13 the fourth player joins $\rightarrow$ set to start 64 seconds from
  now, at 2:09
- At 2:09, the game starts

**Output: 2:09**

The game starts if:

- The timer reaches the time it is set to stop at, or
- The timer reaches zero and there is more than one player, or
- The clash room is filled (8 players in total, 7 have joined)

## Input

- **First line**: An integer `n` for the number of players who join the clash
- **The next** `n` **lines**: Time stamps in the format m:ss (minutes and
  seconds) at which a player joins the clash

## Output

- Output the time stamp at which the game starts in the format m:ss. If no one
  joined, output `NO GAME`

## Constraints

- `n`: Between 0 inclusive and 7 inclusive
- Time stamps: Between 0:00 exclusive and 5:00 exclusive
- The time stamps in the input are always in the right order (no invalid inputs)
