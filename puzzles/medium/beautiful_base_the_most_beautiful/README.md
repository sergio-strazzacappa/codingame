# Beatiful Base: The Most Beautiful

## Goal

Let **n** be a positive integer. A _beautiful base_ of **n** is any integer
**b** &gt; 1 such that log_b(n) is an integer &gt; 1, where log_b(n) denotes the
logarithm of **n** in base **b**.

Find the beautiful base **B** of **n** such that log_B(n) is as large as
possible. We shall refer to **B** as **the most beautiful base of n**.

## Input

-   An integer **n**

## Output

-   The most beautiful base of **n** if it exists otherwise **NONE**

## Constraints

-   1 &leq; **n** &leq; 10 ^ 18
