# Next Car License Plate?

## Goal

French car license plates look like CG-123-BJ.

They are of the form **ab-cde-fg**, where **ab** and **fg** range from **AA** to
**ZZ**, and **cde** ranges from **001** to **999**.

The license plates are generated in alphabetical order:

1.  AA-001-AA, AA-002-AA, AA-003-AA, ..., AA-999-AA,
2.  AA-001-AB, AA-002-AB, AA-003-AB, ..., AA-999-AB,
3.  ...,
4.  AA-001-ZZ, AA-002-ZZ, AA-003-ZZ, ..., AA-999-ZZ,
5.  AB-001-AA, AB-002-AA, AB-003-AA, ..., AB-999-AA,
6.  ...,
7.  ZY-001-ZZ, ZY-002-ZZ, ZY-003-ZZ, ..., ZY-999-ZZ,
8.  ZZ-001-AA, ZZ-002-AA, ZZ-003-AA, ..., ZZ-999-ZZ.

Given the license plate of a car and the number of cars that were registered
after that car, calculate the license plate of the last registered car.

## Input

-   **x**: starting license plate
-   **n**: number of subsequent registered cars

## Output

-   **y**: license plate of the last car registered

## Constraints

-   1 &leq; **n** &leq; 100.000.000
