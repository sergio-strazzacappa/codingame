# Mars Lander - Episode 1

## The Goal

The goal for your program is to safely land the _Mars Lander_ shuttle, the
landing ship which contains the Opportunity rover. Mars Lander is guided by a
program, and right now the failure rate for landing on the NASA simulator is
unacceptable.

**Note that it may look like a difficult problem, but in reality the problem is
easy to solve.** This puzzle is the first level among three, therefore, we need
to present you some controls you won't need in order to complete this first
level.

## Rules

Built as a game, the simulator puts Mars Lander on a limited zone of Mars sky.

The zone is **7000m** wide and **3000m** high.

**For this level**, Mars Lander is above the landing zone, in vertical position,
with no initial speed.

There is a **unique area of flat ground** on the surface of Mars, which is at
least **1000** meters wide.

**Every second**, depending on the current flight parameters (location, speed,
fuel ...), the program must provide the new desired tilt angle and thrust power
of Mars Lander:

Angle goes from **-90°** to **90°**. Thrust power goes from **0** to **4**.

**For this level**, you only need to control the thrust power: the tilt angle
should be 0.

The game simulates **a free fall** without atmosphere. Gravity on Mars is
**3.711 m/s²**. For a **thrust power of X**, a push force equivalent to
**X m/s²** is generated and **X liters of fuel** are consumed. As such, a thrust
power of **4** in an almost vertical position is needed to compensate for the
gravity on Mars.

For a landing to be successful, the ship must:

-   land on flat ground
-   land in a vertical position (tilt angle = 0°)
-   vertical speed must be limited (&leq; 40m/s in absolute value)
-   horizontal speed must be limited (&leq; 20m/s in absolute value)

**Remember that this puzzle was simplified:**

-   the landing zone is just below the shuttle. You can therefore ignore
    rotation and always output 0 as the target angle
-   you don't need to store the coordinates of the surface of Mars to succeed
-   you only need your vertical landing speed to be between 0 and 40m/s – your
    horizontal speed being nil
-   As the shuttle falls, the vertical speed is negative. As the shuttle flies
    upward, the vertical speed is positive

## Note

For this **first level**, Mars Lander will go through a **single test**.

Tests and validators are only slightly different. **A program that passes a
given test will pass the corresponding validator** without any problem.

## Game Input

The program must first read the initialization data from standard input. Then,
within an infinite loop, the program must read the data from the standard input
related to Mars Lander's current state and provide to the standard output the
instructions to move Mars Lander.

### Initialization Input

-   Line 1: the number **surfaceN** of points used to draw the surface of Mars
-   Next **surfaceN** lines: a couple of integers **landX** **landY** providing
    the coordinates of a ground point. By linking all the points together in a
    sequential fashion, you form the surface of Mars which is composed of
    several segments. For the first point, **landX** = **0** and for the last
    point, **landX** = **6999**

### Input For One Game Turn

-   A single line with 7 integers: **X** **Y** **hSpeed** **vSpeed** **fuel**
    **rotate** **power**
    -   **X**, **Y** are the coordinates of Mars Lander (in meters)
    -   **hSpeed** and **vSpeed** are the horizontal and vertical speed of Mars
        Lander (in m/s). These can be negative depending on the direction of
        Mars Lander
    -   **fuel** is the remaining quantity of fuel in liters. When there is no
        more fuel, the power of thrusters falls to zero
    -   **rotate** is the angle of rotation of Mars Lander expressed in degrees
    -   **power** is the thrust power of the landing ship

## Output For One Game Turn

-   A single line with 2 integers: **rotate** **power**
    -   **rotate** is the desired rotation angle for Mars Lander. Please note
        that for each turn the actual value of the angle is limited to the value
        of the previous turn **+/- 15°**
    -   **power** is the desired thrust power. **0** = off. **4** = maximum
        power. Please note that for each turn the value of the actual power is
        limited to the value of the previous turn **+/- 1**

## Constraints

-   2 &leq; **surfaceN** &lt; 30
-   0 &leq; **X** &lt; 7000
-   0 &leq; **Y** &lt; 3000
-   -500 &lt; **hSpeed**, **vSpeed** &lt; 500
-   0 &leq; **fuel** &leq; 2000
-   -90 &leq; **rotate** &leq; 90
-   0 &leq; **power** &leq; 4
-   Response time per turn &leq; 100ms

## Mars Lander - Level 1 - First Contact

**Cape Canaveral, June 21st 2003, 2 a.m. in the morning. Loud voices echo
through the deserted corridors of the Kennedy Space Center.**

_For god's sake Mike! Take off is in less than a month and we still don't have
a reliable solution!_

Square jaws and a military haircut, Jeff is the manager of the Mars Opportunity
mission and right now he's giving his chief engineer a hell of a time.

_But simulations show a success rate of 99%._ \
_So what? 1%, that's huge! Would you bet the success of the mission on that?
And keep in mind, if Opportunity crashes, you and I, we'll both be done for._ \
_The top NASA engineers have already worked on this project. It's the best we
can achieve!_
_Then, let's try with external resources and see if anything better comes out
of it._
